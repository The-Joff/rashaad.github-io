                <p>I'm jUst a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss abot me.</p>

                <p>That sounds about right. Well, mostly. For the educated among us, you would have figured that I am a big Eminem fan.</p>

                <p>I've recently entered the world of coding and this is my "Work-in-progess" website to hone my skills.</p>

                <p>I'll be covering quite a bit of subject matter on my site so I've put everything in little sections or hyperlinks for you to read some more. You can click on each sections for more information.</p>

            <h2>The love for my kids</h2>
                            
                <p>For many years, I've thought of my brood of kids, as my own. Biological or not, theyu're my kids. The sentiment was not always shared. It seems that unmconditional love is not always a two way street, or part of a stepchoild's vocabiulary.</p>
                <p>Kids, aren't they the <em>darnest!</em></p>
