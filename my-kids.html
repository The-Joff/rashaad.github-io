            <h3>My girls.</h3>
            <p>The youngest, <strong>Zoya</strong> I've not been the father I'd always envisoioned to her. Shem is beautiful, and even in my absence, she has taught me a lot.</p>

            <p><strong>Amy</strong>, the eldest. Full of shit that one. Clever to her own detrament. I do honestly think of her as my own child.</p>

            <p><strong>Hannah</strong>, the dark horse. She is an enigma to us all. The lights are home up in that brain of hers, and she is definitely home. A thinker and a grower. With her, Rome is defitely not getting done in a day.</p>

            <h3>My boys.</h3>

            <p><strong>Reilly</strong>. My little apple. It's amaziing how kids carry their parent's traits. I don't know how, I don't know from where he learnt it, this child is just like me. His mannerisnms, his demeanor. These are things kids can't just learn by observing their folks.</p>

            <p><strong>Josh</strong>, even when the girls minus Zoya, had joined "Team Mommy", Josh still had my back. Loyal to the bone! I hope not loyal to a fault. Josh has some deep roots which can scare a person from time to time. THe tree has flourished though, and stands tall.</p>
